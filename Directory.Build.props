        <!-- Set an explicit language version, which should be one that is supported by the official build system.
        This is considered a best practice that can help prevent hard to diagnose runtime errors if someone with a
        newer language support uses a new language feature, but that language feature isn't supported by the underlying
        target framework version. Since our target framework is .NET Standard 2.0, it supports up to C# language version
        7.3. See the following:
        https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/configure-language-version
        However, we have been using newer language version features without any problems. So we will set the version
        to match those features that we are using. -->
